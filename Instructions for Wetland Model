Brief description of Model and its products:

This model is an intuitive mass balance model which strives to capture the water 
budget dynamics, phosphorus dynamics, and nitrogen dynamics. It uses pre-simulated 
daily GWLF runoff, daily precipitation, daily min and max temperature, daily
St. Lawrence water-level, and daily wetland site specific water-level management
plan, data as input in the form of a comma separated values table (.csv). 
The model outputs daily estimates of:
		daily dilution rate, daily outflow, daily simulated peak volume, estimated
        next day volume, daily ET, daily EV, estimated daily peak water level,
        estimated daily next day water level, daily phosphorus concentration,
        daily total phosphorus, daily total mass of phosphorus, daily GWLF estimated 
        phosphorus concentration, daily nitrogen concentration, daily total nitrogen, 
        daily GWLF estimated nitrogen concentration, average daily water level,
        daily inflow, mean daily precipitation, total inflow, total backflow 
        (flow reversal)
These data outputs as a daily data in a .csv file. In addition, several summary plots
of daily dilution rate, daily outflow, daily phosphorus concentration, daily nitrogen 
concentration, average daily water level, total inflow, total backflow (flow reversal).
These daily data and summary plots should be interpreted with caution since GWLF 
operates best at a biweekly (every two week) to monthly time step, and does not always
perform well at a daily time step. Therefore, this code also produces monthly means of 
the aforementioned daily summary plots (more descriptions in the plotting section).

Folder Structure:

There is a specific folder structure that must be followed for the model to successfully
run. The folder structure is more important for the model inputs than it is for the
model outputs. The main folder that contains everything is called "Wetland-Model."
All files and folders in the current configuration are required to reproduce 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wetland-Model folder:
	This folder contains the main "TIBS Wetland Model" (.R file version 3.1), 
	sensitivity analysis code called "Wetland Model Sensitivity" (.R file version 2.3), 
	a .R file to "Plot Distance from River and Watershed Size" (.R file), code to 
	calculate Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies called "Nash_Sutcliffe" (.R file),
	and a .R file that contains all the plotting functions. Lastly, there is a folder
	called "Watersheds."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Watersheds folder:
	This folder contains four folders and three files. The files consist of:
		Waterlevel lm parameters.csv - a file that contains the linear model relationships
		between wetland site water level and the St. Lawrence River water level in sites
		that do not have water control structures (WCS). This file is crucial for 
		estimating wetland water level in sites without WCS. Columns show parameters
		for each site (sites are abbreviated). The first row of values in this file 
		contain the linear model slope for each site, the second row show the intercept.
		The wetland model v3.1 reads in this file and uses these values. see file to
		to see structure and formatting of .
		
		Wetland Parameters.csv - This file contains:
			AOW.cell - area of water in raster cells
			TA.cell - total area of wetlands in raster cells
			AOW - Area of water in meters squared
			TA - Total Area in meters squared
			p.h - starting plank height of a WCS if a site has a WCS each day
					(this variable is changed by the model daily and is different
					from i.ph which is not changed daily, in meters IGLD)
			is.WCS - boolean showing TRUE if a WCS is present and FALSE otherwise
			L - length of the WCS structure weir opening (in inches)
			i.ph - starting plank height of WCS if one is present in meters IGLD
			i.P - initial Phosphorus concentration in kg per Liter
			i.N - initial Nitrogen concentration in kg per Liter
		This file gives wetland area (used in calculating precipitation water input)
		and initial starting conditions for each wetland site. If you wish to change
		initial conditions of the model do so here.
		
		Field Nutrient Data folder - This folder contains surface water concentrations
		of nitrogen and phosphorus. For each site there are two csv files: 1) "__ 
		Nutrient Field Data.csv" the raw field data. 2) "__ Monthly Mean Nutrient 
		Field Data.csv" values in this table are used to plot against the monthly
		phosphorus or nitrogen concentrations estimated by the model (units are
		micromoles per liter). The blanks in 1) and 2) are corresponding wetland
		site abbreviations.
				
		Water level Management Plans folder: There are csv files in this folder.
		Each csv file contains the water management of sites with WCS for a simulated
		time frame. Each row in the file indicates how many cm the WCS weir was raised 
		or lowered each day for the entire simulated period.
		
		Wetland Model Weather folder: This folder contains weather data (Wetland 
		Model Data ____-____.csv). Each file has daily data for precipitation
		(mm) daily max and min temperature (degrees C), and water level for a 
		simulated time period (the start and end years denoted by the blanks in 
		the example csv file). It is important that the dates of these files match 
		the dates of the water level management file. 
		
		WL Seasons ____-____.csv files are used to sort water level simulated by the
		model into ascending, descending, or plateau limbs. These are instances when
		water level is rising, descending or plateauing in the St. Lawrence River.
		These files are not currently used in version 3.1 of the model.
		
		Wetland Sites Folder: This is a larger folder that contains data pertaining
		to each wetland site. Because there is a lot of data in this folder it will
		get its own section

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Wetland Sites Folder:
	Generally, this folder contains a folder for each wetland site and two stand alone
	files. 1) a Wetland Attributes Table.csv and 2) a Years Modeled Table.csv.
		
		Wetland Attributes Table.csv - This files contains the total watershed area
		in square meters (WS.area) and distance to the St. Lawrence River (Dist.TR)
		in meters. This file is not used directly in the wetland model, but is used
		by the "Plot Distance to River and Watershed Size.R" file.
		
		Years Modeled Table.csv - This file simply contains the years and segments
		that are modeled by the wetland model version 3.1. The file is read in by the 
		model. The file also labels the start and end years, whether the time segment
		was a high or low precipitation time segment pre or post MSD.
			Examples: Pre.MSD.S - pre-MSD start year, Post.MSD.E - post-MSD End Year
			High.Prcp years with high precipitation.
			
	Wetland Site folders: Butterfield TIBS, Carpenters TIBS, Deferno TIBS, Delaney TIBS, 
	DorrRoad TIBS, Plum Tree TIBS.
		All these folder contain essentially the same items.
		
		The .gms file - This is a file generated by the GWLF model for use in simulating
		watershed runoff for each wetland site. 
		
		Site Abr. file with no extension - This is another important file generated 
		by the GWLF model for use in simulating water runoff for each wetland site.
		
		__ Nutrient field Data.csv - Values in this table are used to plot against 
		the monthly phosphorus or nitrogen concentrations estimated by the model 
		(units are micromoles per liter). Blanks represent the site abbreviations.
		
		__ Vol cs WL.csv - This file is read in by the model and is used to convert
		water level in the wetland to water volume in the wetland. Because each
		wetland is at a different elevation and have different bathymetric contours
		these tables are different for each site. These tables are very important in
		calculating inflow, outflows, and dilution rates from the wetland. Blanks
		represent the site abbreviations.
		
		*SITE*_Model_IA.RDC - This is meta data file typically read by GIS or IDRISI.
		The wetland model does not read this in. *SITE* represents site abbreviations.
		
		*SITE*_MODEL_IA.RST - This is the accompanying raster file to the .RDC meta
		data file. This file is not used in the wetland model. *SITE* represents 
		site abbreviations.
		
	GWLF input to wetland model folder - This folder contains simulated raw daily 
	GWLF data. The model will automatically search this specific folder (provided
	the folder is the correct place) for the appropriate start and end years (these
	start and end years are controlled by the user in the Years Modeled Table.csv
	file or can be controlled in the R script itself).
	In each file, rows represent specific simulated days and each column represents
	simulated data generated by GWLF. Not all columns are used in the wetland model.
	Only "Daily Prec (cm)", "Daily Flow (m^3)", "TP (kg)" and "TN (kg)" columns are
	used. There should be a separate csv for each time segment to be modelled.
